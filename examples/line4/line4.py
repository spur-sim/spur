"""Toronto Subway Line 4 Simulation Example

This script contains a minimum working example simulating the movement
of subway trains in an idealized version of Line 4. It is designed
as an example of the inputs and outputs required to create a working
simulation model.

This script requires the `spur` package to be installed correctly,
and for the approprate data inputs to be placed in a subfolder called
`line4_data`.
