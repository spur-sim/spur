Installation
============

Spur is currently under active initial development, it is not available
for installation on PyPi or other platforms. If you are interested in installing a developer version in order to contribute
to the project, please see our `contribution guide<Contribution Guide>` for instructions.

If you would like to build the project to test or interact with what is developed
so far, you will need to install the following modules:


* `NetworkX <https://networkx.org/>`_
* `SciPy <https://scipy.org/>`_
* `Simpy <https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_

All of these modules are available on PyPi and can be installed using ``pip``, however we recommend you install the
codebase using Conda.

You can install ``spur`` directly into your environment using::

    pip install .

from the main Spur directory.
